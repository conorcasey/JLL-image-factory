Files in this folder:-

- Autounattend.xml.copy : Generated by Windows System Image Manager and used for unattended install of Windows. This file is
                          copied during execution because passwords for service account users are inserted by replacing the
                          'REPLACEME' scripts with the appropriate password

- setup.ps1 : Script called in Autounattend.xml which is used to run post install tasks such as configure WinRM etc

- UpdateTask.ps1 : Script used to perform Windows Updates. Scheduled as a task in the setup,ps1 script. The script then 
                   setups up auto-logon to true and reboots so that the scheduled task runs on next logon. (It has to 
                   be configured this way unfortunately due to a Microsoft limitation)

- vmtools.cmd : Used for the installation of vmtools. Also called from within the Autounattend.xml
